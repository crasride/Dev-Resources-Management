					<p class="card-text text-center">Just like the vast majority of Web sites use "cookies" to improve the user experience. This use implies own and third-party cookies. (Remember that cookies are plain text files, no larger than 5Kb, totally harmless to your computer)</p>

					<p class="card-text text-center">We use our own cookies mainly to personalize browsing. Basically it is about remembering the authenticated user, with whom you have registered, and thus not having to ask you for the password later on in subsequent accesses. </p>
                    <p class="card-text text-center">It is also possible that (the web browser, plugins etc..) can collect information from your system. That data is controlled by them and does not remain on our servers. They generally store information about the user's profile, derived from browsing the pages you are making. </p>
