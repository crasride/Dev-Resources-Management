  - There is a model for books with the following fields:
  - Techno, language, authors, year, image, pdf, description.

  - There is a template for CheatSheets with the following fields:
	  Techno, image, pdf and description.

# Installation

## To get this project up and running locally on your computer:

1) Set up the [Python development environment](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-django-and-set-up-a-development-environment-on-ubuntu-16-04). We recommend using a Python virtual environment.

	Note: This has been tested against Django 4.1.6 (and may not work or be "optimal" for other versions).
<br></br>
2) Then clone the repository with the code:

```
crasride@ubuntu:~/$ git clone https://github.com/crasride/Dev-Resources-Management.git
```

3) Assuming you have your Python setup, run the following commands (if you're on Windows, you can use py or py-3 instead of python to start Python):

```
crasride@ubuntu:~/$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# Create a superuser Administrator
crasride@ubuntu:~/$ python3 manage.py createsuperuser
# Create a runtime server
crasride@ubuntu:~/$ python3 manage.py runtime server
```
<br></br>

# Usage

### User mode:
- Create a few test books of each type.
Open the tab at http://127.0.0.1:8000 to see the main site, with its new books.

You can then proceed to:

- Create a new user by accepting email, password, and username.

	- Once logged in, you will access the main menu.


      - `List` to list all the books in the database

      - `Search` to retrieve a list of all books by user or technology.

      - Create a `Books`

      - Create a `Cheat Sheet`

      - `Gallery` CheatSheet

      - `Online` to search for a book online connecting the result to Open Library
<br></br>
### Administrator mode:
- Open a browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to open the administration site.

	- Use the `user` created from the `createsuperuser` command
